# Uber Pickups
_Projects unsupervised Machine Learning_

# Goals 🎯
Uber already has data about pickups in major cities. Your objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. Therefore you will:

-  Create an algorithm to find hot zones  
-  Visualize results on a nice dashboard
  
# Scope of this project 🖼️
To start off, Uber wants to try this feature in New York city. Therefore you will only focus on this city. Data can be found here:  

👉👉[ Uber Trip Data ](https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Machine+Learning+non+Supervis%C3%A9/Projects/uber-trip-data.zip)👈👈  

_You only need to focus on New York City for this project_  

# Clustering is your friend
Clustering technics are a perfect fit for the job. Think about it, all the pickup locations can be gathered into different clusters. You can then use cluster coordinates to pin hot zones 😉  

# Create maps with plotly
Check out [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) documentation, you can create maps and populate them easily. Obviously, there are other libraries but this one should do the job pretty well.  

# Deliverable 📬
To complete this project, your team should:

Have a map with hot-zones using any python library ( or anything else).plotly  
You should at least describe hot-zones per day of week.  
Compare results with at least two unsupervised algorithms like KMeans and DBScan.  
Your maps should look something like this:
