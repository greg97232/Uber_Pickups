# Uber Pickups
_Projects unsupervised Machine Learning_

# Goals ðŸŽ¯
Uber already has data about pickups in major cities. Your objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. Therefore you will:

-  Create an algorithm to find hot zones  
-  Visualize results on a nice dashboard
-  
# Create maps with plotly
Check out [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) documentation, you can create maps and populate them easily. Obviously, there are other libraries but this one should do the job pretty well.

# Deliverable ðŸ“¬
To complete this project, your team should:

Have a map with hot-zones using any python library ( or anything else).plotly  
You should at least describe hot-zones per day of week.  
Compare results with at least two unsupervised algorithms like KMeans and DBScan.  
Your maps should look something like this:
